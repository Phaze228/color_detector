**Title: Color Detection and Replacement**

**Description:**

This JavaScript code implements a system to detect a specific color within a video stream and replace it with another color. Key features include:

* **Color Selection:** Select a desired color using a color picker.
* **Detection Algorithm:** Detects pixels within a given threshold of the selected color.
* **K-Means Clustering:** Groups detected pixels into clusters for more refined replacement.
* **Replacement:**  Replaces pixels in identified clusters with a user-specified color.
* **Customization:** Adjust settings, such as the color detection threshold.


**Code Structure**

* **`Detector` Class:**
    * **`constructor`:** Initializes the detector object, sets up color pickers and threshold slider, and creates a debug canvas if enabled.
    * **`detect`:** Detects pixels matching the selected color within the threshold, groups them using K-means clustering, and optionally draws debugging information.
    * **Helper Functions:**  Includes functions to calculate color distances, draw centers of clusters, and more.  

* **Global Functions:**
    * **`renderVideo`:** Sets up webcam access and the main rendering loop.
    * **`kMeans`:** Implements the K-means clustering algorithm.
    * **Helper Functions:** Functions for converting between color formats (hex, RGB, HSV), calculating distances between colors, getting average colors, etc.

**Additional Notes**

* The accuracy of color detection depends on lighting conditions and the selected threshold.
* Modify the code to customize the behavior and integrate it into your larger project.
